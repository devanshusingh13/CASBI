Premium is the amount of money (price) you have to pay to continue your insurance policy. The premium amount depends on: 
Your age 
Policy selected 
Mode of premium payment 
Term of premium payment 
Term of the policy 
You can choose to pay premium monthly, quarterly, half yearly, annually or as a Single payment. 
Term 
Term stands for the number of years you choose to insure yourself. 
Policy terms vary for different plans. Some policies have fixed terms while others offer you a range of terms. 
It is the period, in years, during which the contractual benefits are payable 
Premium paying term 
It refers to the number of years you pay premium on your policy. 
Usually the premium paying term is the same as the policy term. However, some policies offer you the option of selecting a premium paying term that is lower than the policy term. 
Sum Assured / Face Amount 
Sum Assured (SA) is the agreed amount payable under the policy, upon the happening of insured events(e.g. Death, Maturity, Rider Benefit payout etc) in relation to Life Assured (LA is the person whose life is covered under the insurance contract). 
Bonus / Participating Profit 
Bonuses are declared under traditional participating policies i.e the policies that participate in the profits of Insurance company. 
Bonus is based on an insurance company’s assumptions about the future performance. Like any other assumption, actual results will vary. 
Survival Benefit 
It is the amount of money received at pre-fixed, regular intervals by the insured person, upon survival. 
Maturity Benefit 
It is the amount of money received by the insured, upon survival till the end of policy term.

Returns or Pre-tax yield 
Interest earned on the premium, on a compounded basis, is the pre-tax yield. 
Post-tax yield 
Many life insurance policies entitle the policy holder to tax benefits on the premium paid. If the premium is used as a tax deduction under section 80C, then the effective premium paid by the insured is lower. Interest earned on the effective premium, on a compounded basis, is known as the post-tax yield. "

Such a movement of your money from one fund to another fund available to you in your life insurance plan, is termed as switching.

The exact grace period depends upon the type of policy. "
What is Deferment Period?,It is the period between the date of subscription to an insurance-cum-pension policy and the date on which you receive the first installment of pension. Such policies generally prescribe a minimum and maximum limit on the deferment period.
